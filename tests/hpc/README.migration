HPC Migration

The tests rely on the fact that openQA fixed directory contains ready
qcow2 images. Those should be registered against SCC for base products,
as well as relevant parts: HPC and all other needed modules, patterns
etc. For multimachine set-up there should be separate qcow2 registered.

The overall idea is to run some functional tests on system before the
actual migration. Then the system should be patched and eventually
migrated.

Upon successful migration the HPC cluster of VMs should be re-booted,
and all sanity checks should be performed, so that one can check if
all relevant parts of the HPC cluster still work as expected.

This means that the migration testing is focused here on checking
certain HPC functionalities and how do they behave upon migration and
not on the migration process per-se.

Overall, in terms of programatical approach, the concept differs from
existing migration tests, as instead of using openQA modules with run()
functions, the tests are calling relevant functions which take care of
migration logic. This approach allows - for instance - to create
barriers without complicating existing openQA migration modules.

Test organization
-----------------
-----------------


N1: FROM SPX to SPX+1
-----------------
MIGRATION_N1_A - single machine tests checking basics
-- migration from SPX to SPX+1
-- checking for both supported arches
-- checking for zypper online
-- checking for correct migration targets
-- basic migration of a single machine

MIGRATION_N1_B - cluster tests checking HPC functionality upon migration
-- migration from SPX to SPX+1
-- focused on zypper online migration as relevant for multimachine set-ups
-- starting the cluster on older SP
-- conducting HPC functional tests
-- running online zypper migration
-- restarting the cluster
-- conducting HPC functional tests

N2: FROM SPX to SPX+2
-----------------
MIGRATION_N2_A - single machine tests checking basics
-- migration from SPX to SPX+2
-- the same as MIGRATION_A but:

MIGRATION_N2B - cluster tests checking HPC functionality upon migration
-- migration from SPX to SPX+2
-- the same as MIGRATION_B but:
