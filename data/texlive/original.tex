\section*{LaTeX â€“ A document preparation system}

LaTeX is a \textit{high-quality typesetting \textsc{system;}} it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. 
LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

\subsection*{An introduction to LaTeX}

LaTeX, which is pronounced ``Lah-tech'' or ``Lay-tech'' (to rhyme with ``blech'' or ``Bertolt Brecht''), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for unusefull technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

LaTeX is not a \textbf{word processor!} Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content.


\subsection*{Documentation distributed with LaTeX}
A \emph{short} introduction to LaTeX (with some focus on the differences between the old LaTeX 2.09 and current standard LaTeX2e) is given in the following document.
